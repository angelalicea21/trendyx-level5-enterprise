ðŸŽ¯ PERFECT! RAILWAY AS HOST WITH GODADDY DOMAIN - EXPERT SOLUTION
Excellent setup! You have a GoDaddy domain (www.trendyx-ai.com) and want Railway as your host. Let me give you the expert solution:
âœ… RAILWAY + PHP CAPABILITY:
YES, Railway can run PHP! But for your setup, I have an even better solution that's simpler and more reliable.
ðŸš€ RECOMMENDED APPROACH: SINGLE RAILWAY PROJECT
Since you want Railway as your host, let's deploy your main website AND the TrendyX AI platform together in one Railway project. This is the most efficient approach.
ðŸ“‹ STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION:
STEP 2: ADD INTEGRATION TO YOUR EXISTING RAILWAY PROJECT
Instead of PHP, let's use a Node.js solution (which Railway handles perfectly):

    Add the integration files to your existing TrendyX AI Railway project
    Serve your main website from the same Railway deployment
    Use Node.js endpoints instead of PHP (more reliable on Railway)

STEP 3: DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
Point your GoDaddy domain to Railway:

    In GoDaddy: Update DNS to point to Railway
    In Railway: Add your custom domain www.trendyx-ai.com
    Result: Your main website AND TrendyX AI both accessible from your domain

ðŸŽ¯ WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO:

    Create the Node.js integration files (instead of PHP) for your Railway project?
    Show you how to add your main website to the existing Railway deployment?
    Guide you through the GoDaddy â†’ Railway domain setup?

This approach gives you everything on one platform with your custom domain! ðŸš€
